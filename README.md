Testing practices on the Buggy Rating site https://buggy.justtestit.org/
# Steps
Creation of user stories to test the Buggy Cars Rating site.
Based on the user stories, test cases are created to cover all the functionalities of the web application and detect possible bugs.
The test cases are executed and documented in the Excel file.
Creation of manual tests.
Creation of automated tests.

- When executing manual tests, bugs are found. A report is prepared with the details of each bug. 

- After executing all the test cases defined in the user stories, we are going to perform 
some exploratory tests, which are not defined in the acceptance criteria of the user stories.
We just freely browse the web application to see what errors we find.

- Test cases are defined in excel and in Jira. Also bug reports.

- I use Testrail as a test case manager. Where I add the test cases and execute them.
